# **Welcome!**

1. Please _fork_ this repo onto your personal github account that you have created.

2. Once you have forked the repo onto your personal github, _pull_ your forked onboarding repo down to your local machine.

3. In your local _IDE_ create a directory labeled with your name. **_all_** of your assignments will be added to **_only_** your directory. Once your personal directory is added to your local machine, _push_ it up to your forked repo. Your github environment should be setup and ready for new code additions **_VERY EXCITING_**.

4. Each new assignment we give you through the Trello board will task you with first creating a directory titled after whatever assignment you are working on, and then implementing the assignment within the appropriate directory.

For Example:

### Hello World Trello assignment:
- Inside your personal directory create a folder called "Hello World"
- Implement all code changes pertaining to the Hello World assignment inside the "Hello World" folder you created.
